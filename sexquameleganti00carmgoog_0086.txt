hundred years Let it be imputed to ambition when what
is not just and reasonable is sought for in war, or when war
is immediately commenced without laying the case before
the other side and giving thern a chance os repentance But
what ground for'calumnycan there be against us, who, aswe
have said, have demanded back what was anciently our own,
bave called him neighbour‚ have peacesully exhorted him i
We put off all recourse to arms for so many years, and
by our mildness we daily made him more obstinate in bis
purpose Those have disturbed the peace of ltaly whose
habit it is to disturb it, and who have driven that wretched ⁵
Prince, deceived by their promises, to prefer war to peace
Not we, however, who have omitted nothing by exhorting,
advising, finally praying that he should prefer peace to
war: we predicted, protested that he would pay the penalty
os his folly. For the rest that concerns our course, Your
Excellencies will obtain information from our letter to
⁸the Supreme Pontiff ; from which, we think, there will be
no one ol so distorted or malignant a judgment that be
can accuse usos being in the wrong, or of having omitted
anything· that becomes the most modest and temperate ol
men.
