that our admonitions were applied not in the proper time,
the best judge oi human actions, but at the end of the war,
aiter so much expense, aster the death of many citizenS,
· after the enemy had been besieged. We certainly are
ignorant what new sort os calumny this is that has been
invented, when you say that you had wished ior peace
even from the beginning, to which had we exhorted you,
we should easily have obtained anything from you. This
excuse can by no means be received, ior that we were
cheated no one will dare deny, who knows the sequel,
from which your intention towards us before the war,
and your pre-arranged plan of carrying on the war
in Ferrara‚ are clearer than day. And if you wish to
truly estimate what has been done by us, you will
see indeed that in so far as concerned concord and the
’ observance os our treaty‚ we both satisfied you by letter,
and osten and long treated with your ambassador; and,
moreover, omitted nothing that we thought would make
sor your honour and the quietos Italy. We were unwilling
to proceed to the censure oi a Bull, because you gave a ,
certain hope ol concord and noprospect os making war.
ln which hope while we rested,and nevertheless exhorted you
to send us your claims in legal sorm, you against justice, in
despite of us whom you knew to have a horror os war, alto-
gether without our knowledge, advanced impious arms in
open war against Ferrara. And that you may the more
clearly perceive our intentioris towards you and the obser·
vance os our treaty‚ see what we have suffered through you.
