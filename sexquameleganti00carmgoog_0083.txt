16 EPISTLES.

Christendom? Is we should say that wc have done great ſs
things, we should be noted lor arrogance; modesty has
always be'en becoming to words, magnanimity to deeds.
Let it therefore be left to your judgment, and that os
the whole world. What Your Beatitude can hope
lor irorn this man we do not see; froin uscertainly you
may hope something. 1f we have not done anything ’
great, still wc have at times done something, and with,
God's help we hope to do more. Why should Your Beati-
tude be displeased with our victory? We have convoked

no council; we have planned no schism3 we have not
harassed you with war. Neither up to the present time
have we learned to attack Christians in war with an infidel
soldiery. Truly this benefit of the Church conferred upon ’
uS, bought by our blood, we shall both defend with our
good offices, and strenuouSIy take care that it may not seern

to be perversely applied. It has been resolved, with your
good pardon, Holy Father, and decreed to prosecute this
war; foras the benediction ol the most Holy Patriarch when

once conferred upon his son, either could not, or certainly
should not be torn away lrorn him, so we cannot but
hope lor a happy issue to that war which the authority ol '
the Supreme and Holy Pontiff roused, impelled, and pro-
voked.
