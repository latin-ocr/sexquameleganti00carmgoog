WB wrote some days ago, with patemal love, to Your
Nobility the causes not less just than necessary which
urged us, on behals os the sasety of all Italy and os the
Christian commonwealth, to arrangea peace, exhorting that
you should accept the same, and withdraw from the
war against Ferrara, which is our city, and that of the
“ Roman Church, and that you should restore the places
you had occupied ; and we treated with you about this in
the most courteous terms, not using even one word that
could offend either yoursels or your honour. But you sent
us a letter in reply written by you in terms far different
from what we hoped that we should read, painting the
Ferrarese war with many lying colourS, and imputing to us
motives which never existed, and never entered into our
mind ; and this has therefore affected us with trouble and
the greatest grief, ior it has shown that your mind and
soul are averse to that peace and alliance which we had
resolved to make among the States oi Italy, and that you
vehemently abhor thern. We had hoped indeed to be able
as osten as we might wish to judge of you exactly as though
you were the most obedient of our sons ; and thus when
we had persuaded the other princes or potentates os Italy
to arrange a peace and alliance, we appeared to have so
gained all our desires, that no difficulty or trouble remained
