Italy. And thus you may consult your own welsare and
the tranquillity of the whole ol Italy. Otherwise we shall
not any further conceal that we shall proeeed against you
with spiritual and temporal arms, as shall to us seem
expedient, and as justice shall persuade. For that lust of
domination in you is not to be borne ; it is too inhuman,
too irreligious, and too unlike a Christian, especially
when it is exhibited towards Christ and His Vicar. We
therefore wish forpublic peace in Italy, that we may at

, the same time guard against the injuries of wars, and at the ⁰

same time restore all men to tranquillity, and with the
united strength ol the Christian Commonweal take counsel
against our most fierce enemies

WE have steadlastly read and modestly what Your
Holiness advises and counsels in your letter. Whatever
you have done, alter violating the terms ol our treaty, and ’
neglecting both our ancient and recent services to the,

Apostolic See, we submit to with a cheersul mind. Is the
power ol loosing and binding is granted to you, even in a
matter ol this kind, it is sufficient for us that it has
happened through no fault of our own, that you deserted us
who with our money, our army and fleet routed that viper
